        <title>Week 3 is Bye Terminal Hi Web!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a gruesome past week of algorithms and data structures, we were finally introduced to the world of web. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the week, we learned the following skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessed data from the OpenWeather Api and Github Api &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built a Webscraper and Displayed search results from Dice.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with Sinatra to build game applications such as RockPaperScissors and Blackjack21&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implemented our Dice.com Webscraper program with Sinatra&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it was really fun working with Sinatra. It really puts into perspective how real web applications work (through HTTP requests) as opposed to the script-like single thread programs ran through our Terminals(previous projects). We learned how valuable information are stored in cookies and sessions(big cookie), and exactly how annoying that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, we dive into the big boy version of Sinatra, otherwise known as Rails. I’m excited. It feels like we’re finally ramping up and learning the skills required of a Web Developer. I’m excited to see what Rails has to offer and how exactly it differs from Sinatra. s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>Week 2 is Algorithms, Data Structures, and the Big O</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we cracked down the fundamentals of CS, Data-structures and the art of sorting and arranging data. We learned many basic algorithms, such as insertion, Bubble Merge, Selecting, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc. We also learned how to use Trees and Linked Lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not my cup of tea, but definitely something necessary to learn for my future as a coder!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 1 is OO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Eat, sleep, and breath code.That’s what I’ve been doing since VCS officially started last Tuesday. It’s been a blast. I’ve learned so much. And there’s still so much more to learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past week, I learned what it means to program in OO. I learned how to properly structure parts of my code into separate objects and classes, and how to test them using a Ruby Gem(rspec) as well. I also learned that no matter how well you thought your code was written, it could always be written better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited for what Week 3 brings. To my understanding, we’ll be diving more deeply into testing and afterwards alghorithms &amp;amp; data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my spare time I will be starting a website/blog of my own where I will be able to showcase some code I’ll have worked on throughout the weeks. Look forward to it! Sloppy and messy code that is. Don’t worry, it will get better :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day_1.end.Wowow.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I got kicked in the ass. Holy bungalo. Just. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first signed up for Viking Code School(VCS), I knew it was going to be difficult. I knew it would be intense. I knew I had a lot of learning to do. I knew it was a “get out what you put in” sort of scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But man, my mind was completely blown. We spend the day practicing mainly two things: block methods and Object Orientated Programming(OOP). Sounds simple right? Maybe it is. But today, I had one of the biggest learning experiences of my life. Today marks the day I discovered the true meaning of OOP. I had no idea how even the smallest things could be broken down into single-piece legoblocks. Today, I got a glimpse of Modular Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to keep my eyes wide open. There’s so much to learn. I’m so excited. I might burn out. Worth it. If I manage to come out of this program alive, I’ll literally be a God. Okay, time to get back to the drawing board. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Viking Code School</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prepped this whole week with Ruby and HTML/CSS. It’s not much, but this is the start of something new! I’m going to learn so much in the next 12 weeks. Hopefully this will be the kickstart to the Coding career I’ve imagined for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. From here on out, we start at 0. I’m temporarily transforming into a sponge. There are so many talented people here. I’m going to learn all their skills and make them my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a process, a journey, but I’m so damn excited for it. The grind starts now. At age 21, my life is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
