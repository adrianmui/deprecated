```python
require 'pry'
```

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from 
robbing each of them is that adjacent houses  have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into 
on the same night. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can 
rob tonight without alerting the police.

This is a dynamic programming problem. an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula.

In this problem we need to find the maximum sum of integers in an array where the integers cannot be an index next to each other.

Hint: if a value is greater than both its neighbors(combined value), then choose that value!

```
test cases
nums1 = [1,3,1]
nums2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
nums3 = [2,1,1,4]
```


```ruby
  def rob(nums)
    return 0 if nums.empty? || nums.nil?
    return nums[0] if nums.length == 1

    start_index_one_or_two = [nums[0], nums[1]].max
    arr = [nums[0], start_index_one_or_two]
    i = 2
    while i != nums.length
      arr[i] = [arr[i-2] + nums[i], arr[i-1]].max
      i += 1
    end
    arr.last
  end
```

At index i, you have to choose which to add, (i-2) or (i-3)

Therefore DP formula is :: DP[i] = max(DP[i-2], DP[i-3]) + num[i]

<!--
def rob2(nums)
  return 0 if nums.empty? || nums.nil?
  return nums[0] if nums.length == 1

  top = nums[0]
  bot = 0

  i = 1
  while i != nums.length
    temp = top > bot ? top : bot
    top = bot + nums[i]
    bot = temp
    i += 1
  end

  (top > bot) ? top : bot
end

This is the more refined version doing the same thing.  -->

```
  tests 3,9,6
  p rob(nums1)
  p rob(nums2)
  p rob(nums3)
```


Time Complexity is linear, O(n)
