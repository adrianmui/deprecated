<p>After a gruesome past week of algorithms and data structures, we were finally introduced to the world of web. <br /></p>

<p>During the week, we learned the following skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accessed data from the OpenWeather Api and Github Api </li>
  <li>Built a Webscraper and Displayed search results from Dice.com</li>
  <li>Worked with Sinatra to build game applications such as RockPaperScissors and Blackjack21</li>
  <li>Implemented our Dice.com Webscraper program with Sinatra</li> </ul>

<p>That said, it was really fun working with Sinatra. It really puts into perspective how real web applications work (through HTTP requests) as opposed to the script-like single thread programs ran through our Terminals(previous projects). We learned how valuable information are stored in cookies and sessions(big cookie), and exactly how annoying that is.</p>

<p>Next week, we dive into the big boy version of Sinatra, otherwise known as Rails. I’m excited. It feels like we’re finally ramping up and learning the skills required of a Web Developer. I’m excited to see what Rails has to offer and how exactly it differs from Sinatra. s</p>
