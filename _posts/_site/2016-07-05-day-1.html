<p>I got kicked in the ass. Holy bungalo. Just. Wow.</p>

<p>When I first signed up for Viking Code School(VCS), I knew it was going to be difficult. I knew it would be intense. I knew I had a lot of learning to do. I knew it was a “get out what you put in” sort of scenario.</p>

<p>But man, my mind was completely blown. We spend the day practicing mainly two things: block methods and Object Orientated Programming(OOP). Sounds simple right? Maybe it is. But today, I had one of the biggest learning experiences of my life. Today marks the day I discovered the true meaning of OOP. I had no idea how even the smallest things could be broken down into single-piece legoblocks. Today, I got a glimpse of Modular Design.</p>

<p>I need to keep my eyes wide open. There’s so much to learn. I’m so excited. I might burn out. Worth it. If I manage to come out of this program alive, I’ll literally be a God. Okay, time to get back to the drawing board. :)</p>
