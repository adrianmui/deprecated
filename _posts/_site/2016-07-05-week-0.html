<p>Prepped this whole week with Ruby and HTML/CSS. It’s not much, but this is the start of something new! I’m going to learn so much in the next 12 weeks. Hopefully this will be the kickstart to the Coding career I’ve imagined for myself.</p>

<p>They say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. From here on out, we start at 0. I’m temporarily transforming into a sponge. There are so many talented people here. I’m going to learn all their skills and make them my own.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a process, a journey, but I’m so damn excited for it. The grind starts now. At age 21, my life is just beginning.</p>
